            0: "<b>Pharaoh Farm Pot</b> is a high-risk high-reward contract developed by the Pharaoh for the Cairo Army. The goal here is to spread the word about Cairo Finance and its great ecosystem while earning up to 1% per day like the Cairo OGs know it back then from the good old Maximizer.\n\nPlayers can extend their earnings through team-based referrals.",
            1: "<b>The Basics</b>\n\nWhen a user deposits CAF tokens, they will earn daily returns of up to 1% for a maximum of 365% of their deposit amount. Upon reaching 365% returns, the user must then double their initial deposit to maintain their profits and avoid losing their structure.\n\nThe user can expedite reaching 365% by referring others, but it is not possible to earn more than 365%. Ref rewards can be claimed at any time, but caution is advised - do not spend more tokens than necessary for the required double deposit.\n\nThere is also no compounding function. Still you can save rewards for the double up or you can create a new account and enjoy advantages of compound interest.",

            3: "<b>About the contract sustainability</b>\n\nThe Pharaoh Farm Pot is sustained by continued community support, just like every other crypto high-yield project. The difference is, the Pharaoh Farm Pot also has a mechanism <b>(Payout Structure + Anti-Dump Mechanics)</b> to guarantee the sustainability. On the other hand, Cairo Finance generates revenue in $CAF through different products and can top up the contract too.",

            5: "<b>Taxes</b>\n\nTaxes reduce volatility and are used to support the protocol as follows:\n\nDeposit:    15%       (Ref System)\nWithdraw: 10%       (to contract)",
            6: "<b>Anti-Dump Mechanics</b>\n\nThe Anti Dump Mechanics was added “to not outpace other users in the game, forcing them to kick back some of their rewards to the community and maintain  the sustainability of the project!  Users will incur additional taxes based on what percent their deposit is compared  to the total amount of CAF in the Pharaoh Farm Pot. For example, once a person’s  deposit reaches 1% of the total Pharaoh farm pot supply, they will be charged an  additional 5% (5%+10% so 15% total) in taxes on their withdraws<a href='https://886542820-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F6OlEDNp0Lg8Vw0y4Xupc%2Fuploads%2FRvLgEXsIJunpiOuwewss%2FBildschirm%C2%ADfoto%202023-01-25%20um%2017.18.29.png?alt=media&token=cad60a2d-8324-4f34-b923-cd9708a15a04'>.</a>",
